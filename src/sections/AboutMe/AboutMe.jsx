                    I am a software developer who enjoys full stack programming
                    as well as foundational computer mechanisms. Iâ€™m currently
                    pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at the University
                    of Guelph. I am in my 4th year of the coop program and have
                    gained an extensive amount of experience from projects and
                    past jobs throughout that time. I am passionate about
                    solving problems and working in a team environment to expand
                    my knowledge of software development even more!
